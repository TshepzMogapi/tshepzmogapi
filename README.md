### Hi there 👋

Certified human🧍🏾‍♂️. Software Engineer 👨🏾‍💻 / 🐛 Bug-finder 🔍 (and sometimes, bug-introducer) 🌪️.
Or, as I prefer to think of it, a professional problem-solver 🧩 who occasionally writes code and plays with technology.
My primary goal is to build things that work, while simultaneously ensuring AI 🤖 doesn't render me obsolete by the time I come back from my vacation 🏖️ next Tuesday 🗓️.

Beyond the keyboard ⌨️, I'm passionate about sports 🏅 and travel 🛫. 
I've proudly represented South Africa 🇿🇦 on the international stage in Australian Football 🏉 and Gaelic Games ⚽. I bring the same dedication and teamwork 💪🏽 I've honed in sports to my development work.
